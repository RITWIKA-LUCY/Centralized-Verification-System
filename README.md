Central Verification System (CVS)

Idea Description
1. The Idea
1.1 The proposed technical solution is the establishment of a Central Verification System (CVS), which will serve as a single point of access for students, institutions, and state authorities across the country to enable institution level verification of the students of one state studying in other state.

1.2 The Central Verification System will verify the academic authenticity of the student through a 2-step verification process.

1.3 After verification, the CVS system will generate a unique 12-digit CVS ID which will serve as the academic identification ID of the student.

1.4 This CVS ID will be used on any state scholarship portal to enable the institution level verification of the student.

2. Working of the Central Verification System
2.1 If a student’s institution is NOT registered on the state scholarship portal, then the institution level verification of the student can be done using his/her CVS ID.

2.2 The student will have to create an account on the Centralized Verification Portal.

2.3 After the account creation, the student will upload his/her details (including the ABC-ID), documents and biometrics (fingerprint) on the CVS system.

2.4 After uploading the details, his/her authenticity will be verified by the CVS system using a 2-step verification process.

2.5 At level-1, the student’s ABC ID will be verified from the Central Database using an API request. It will validate his/her university information. This process will filter out genuine and legit applications for the scholarship.

2.6 Every institution across the country will have to be registered on the CVS system. Through their account, they will maintain a database of currently enrolled students.

2.7 At level-2, the student’s biometrics (fingerprint) will be used to access this database from the institution. The uploaded documents on the CVS system and the documents from the database will be matched using Adobe Acrobat’s Document Comparison Technology. This process will validate the academic authenticity of the student.

2.8 After the verification process, the CVS system will generate a unique 12-digit CVS ID which will be the academic identification ID of the student.

2.9 This CVS ID can be used on any state scholarship portal to enable the institution level verification of the student.
